Description: MCTestAnalysis provides useful interfaces and functions to assist
    with the analysis of data from a typical multiple-choice test. The user
    needs only to provide an answer key that optionally identifies the concept or
    topic of each question and a table of responses given by each student to the
    questions in the test. MCTestAnalysis provides a Shiny web app interface
    and an automatic report-generation tool featuring concepts from Classical 
    Test Theory, Item Response Theory and structural analysis. We regard this 
    package to be a work-in-progress and encourage contributions.
