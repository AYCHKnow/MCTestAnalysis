Description: The purpose of this generated report is to provide the analytical
    framework proposed in the paper "An Analytic Framework for Evaluating the
    Validity of Concept Inventory Claims" (Natalie Jorion et al., 2015) from
    the University of Chicago, while providing extra statistical routines based
    on Classical Test Theory. Within the contents of this package, you will find
    graphical representations such as plots and graphs and tables all intended
    to validate the 3 claims proposed in Jorion's paper.
